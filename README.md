# Color Shooter

This is a brief 15-minute color-changing FPS game created using Unreal Engine 5.2.1. The player's objective is to reach the end of each level while aligning their character's color with that of the various objects they encounter along the way. If there is a color mismatch, the level restarts. To eliminate enemies, the player must hit them with bullets of colors that differ from their own. Collecting enemy bullets that match the player's color replenish ammunition.
